# Battle Tank

This is a game about... Oh, this is not a game yet.

It's started because I have took the [course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/). 

Now, in this version, player can drive a tank which looks powerful but actually weak, to fight with other tens of AI tank with crazy movement and high accuracy.



## Development

* Version: [Unreal Engine 4]([https://www.unrealengine.com/](http://www.baidu.com/link?url=aaoWkzwdoF7Gr-RfER1k3bDxNWeCMEV7nWS9vRP76yVv-9piIoD0aR12udmVxYrF)).15
* Machine: i5 4460 + GTX970, i5 6600 + RX480


* Developing rules:
  * Blueprint handles all of UI, asset initialization  
  * New feature should be tested in Blueprint first
  * Pointer should be well protected and checked before used
  * Cpp handles most of game logic
